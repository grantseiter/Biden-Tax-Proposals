# OG-USA

OG-USA is an overlapping-generations (OG) model of the economy of the United States (USA) that allows for dynamic general equilibrium analysis of federal tax policy. The model output focuses changes in macroeconomic aggregates (GDP, investment, consumption), wages, interest rates, and the stream of tax revenues over time. Documentation of the model theory--its output, and solution method--is available [here](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-USA/blob/master/docs/OGUSAdoc.pdf) and is regularly updated.  Documentation for the Python API for OG-USA is available [here](https://og-usa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


## Disclaimer

The model is currently under development. Users should be forewarned that the
model components could change significantly. Therefore, there is NO GUARANTEE
OF ACCURACY. THE CODE SHOULD NOT CURRENTLY BE USED FOR PUBLICATIONS, JOURNAL
ARTICLES, OR RESEARCH PURPOSES. Essentially, you should assume the calculations are unreliable until we finish the code re-architecture and have checked the results against other existing implementations of the tax code. The package will have released versions, which will be checked against existing code prior to release. Stay tuned for an upcoming release!
